## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a web page or app. It shows where elements like buttons, images, text, and menus will be placed—without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

Wireframes are usually made in black and white and serve as a blueprint for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the basic functionality and user flow of a product.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process because:

- 🧠 **Clarifies Ideas Early**: Helps teams and clients agree on layout and structure before investing time in full design or development.
- ✏️ **Improves Communication**: Makes it easier to discuss ideas visually.
- 🔄 **Supports Iteration**: Wireframes are quick to create and easy to change, which encourages testing and refining early on.
- 🚀 **Saves Time and Cost**: Catching issues at the wireframe stage prevents bigger problems later in the process.

Wireframing sets a strong foundation for building user-friendly and effective products.
